        <h1>Kevin Wong's NM2207 Final Project: Journey</h1>
        <h2>“Time flies” and the days go by in a blur. Oftentimes we are too focused on living our day to day life, fixated on our problems and daily tasks, failing to do what we are meant to do: live in the moment and enjoy life. Journey is an application that allows the user to document their daily reflections on whether they were living in the past, present or future. By doing so, the user is able to see their progress, reflect, and improve themselves over time.
